ba ba black sheep 
have you any wool
Baa baa black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes sir, yes sir, three bags full!
One for the master, one for the dame,
And one for the little boy who lives down the lane.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star
How I wonder what you are
Up above the world so high
Like a diamond in the sky
